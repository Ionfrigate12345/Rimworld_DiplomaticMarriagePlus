Diplomatic Marriage & Permanent Alliance, or Diplomatic Marriage Plus (DMP), is heavily inspired by Paradox game Crusader Kings, and by Diplomatic Marriage event in the mod [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2379076640] More Faction Interactions [/url] as a starting point, which is also why I call this mod Diplomatic Marriage "Plus".
		
[h3] Features: [/h3] 

- You can now form a permanent alliance(PA) by marrying off one of the child of your colony ideology leader to one of your vanilla ally. PA goodwill will quickly increase each day, usually be locked to 100 (if your child has high social skill) unless you really do something terrible. 

- While enjoying benefits like endless caravan or military reinforcement, you need to work hard to keep the union, such as keeping the couple safe or avoid changing ideology leader, just like how it often works in CK alliance. WARNING: In most time the couple are not your pawns so it wont be so easy.


[h3] How to start [/h3]

You can't start the proposal volunteerly, you need to meet the condition then wait your ally to do so.

- Your colony must have ideology leader
- Your ideology leader must have an adult, unmarried child. DIRECT DESCENDENT only. Nephew or grandchildren do not count. (BTW this is also how alliance mostly works in CK)
- You need to have at least one NPC ally faction with goodwill >= 75

After all conditions met, NPC ally will propose randomly. Since the conditions are already hard enough, I set the event chance pretty high so that you wont wait for long.


[h3] What happens after PA? [/h3]

- Daily goodwill increase with the ally faction
- Randomly convert the entire ally faction to your ideology
- PA may randomly send you Rimcities quests if you have it installed, such as joint attack a large city.
- You can request items of your choice to your PA, if you have A Petition For Provitions installed. 
- Caravan Refuge: PA together with the couple may seek refuge in your colony for raiders are behind them.
- Homesick: Your child may miss their parents and come back as your temporary pawns. This event is mostly for giving you an opportunity to give them equipments and xenogenes so that they wont die easily in future battles.

More post-marriage events will be added in the future.


[h3] Potential Interaction with other mods [/h3]

This mod shall work with most mods. But since the key couple is considered as world pawns of your ally NPC faction, [b]it may change abit the gameplay of other mods[/b].

In a simple word, some other mods or even Vanilla may also spawn them on your map as world pawns from another faction. But whatever the reason, you need to protect them to keep the PA.


[h3] Example of mods having playstyle impacted by DMP [/h3]

- [b]Vanilla[/b]: If you abuse the nearly endless goodwill of your ally to call for military help on some hard raids, you may put the couple in danger for they are likely to appear in the reinforcement.

- [b]Factional War[/b]: You are no longer just a "bystander" like the author says. When your permanent ally is involved in the war and your child or child-in-law happen to be in their army, you'd better think of a quick intervention. 

- [b]Dynamic Diplomacy[/b]: it's recommended to turn off battle simulation for the couple may be involved in a battle faraway making you unable to save them. Also other NPC factions may randomly convert your PA to other ideologies even after your child successfully convert them.

- [b]Hospitality[/b]: The couple may appear as guests if you invite your permanent allied faction. It should be fine but DO NOT RECRUTE THEM. Same for any similar mod, or even vanilla and dev mode, in no way you shall attempt to change their faction on your own. There is a script to detect and correct their faction by force, but better not fully rely on it.

- [b]VE Ideology[/b]: Some memes like Crafting Culture may force unwanted leader. It may be a challenge with DMP for changing ideology leader other than parents will break the PA.

- [b]Glitterworld Destroyer 4 & VE - Mechanoids[/b]: Mechs are insanely powerful in these mods, especially GD4. So watch out if the couple are present in a fight involving mechs, including your own ones (I mean friendly fire).

By having someone in another faction that you need to worry about, there are endless possibilities of new playstyles DMP can offer, depending on your mod list. 


[h3] Collaborated mods [/h3]

- [b]Rimcities[/b]: PA will give you their own version of some Rimcities quests like city assault. You can now help PA to conquer the world.

- [b]A Petition For Provisions[/b]: Items request becomes a privilege exclusively for PA and comes with CD depending on their power (percentage of global settlements). Together with Rimcities or other diplomacy mods (Dynamic Diplomacy, Rim War, etc.) you can help your PA to conquer the world so that you can have more benefit as well. See description in mod config option for more info.


[h3] Compatible mods [/h3]

[b]-SOS2[/b]: My script identifies SOS2 space map and prevent all inappropriate events of this mod (like ally caravan or temporary stay) from firing there, so that you wont see your child/child-in-law spawn and die in space without EVA suits. However if you use other pawn spawning mods non compatible with SOS2, this issue may still happen. Plz check SOS2 page for compatible mod list.


[h3] Requirement of DLC: [/h3] 

[b]Ideology: Required[/b]. The mod takes Ideology leader as your colony leader.

[b]Biotech: Not a must-have but recommended[/b] for growth vat which help to raise a skillful child much faster. Xenogenes like Deathless and Ageless are also helpful to keep them alive to ensure the PA (Remember the power of Immortal trait in CK2).

[h3] FAQ: [/h3] 

[b]- Why do you need to make another dedicated mod apart from MFI? [/b]

MFI is my own must-have as well. This mod is also inspired by MFI, which is why I name it Diplomatic Marriage PLUS.

However there are too many events in MFI, and it is impossible to go too deep on a single one. The diplomatic marriage event in MFI only sacrifice a random colonist for a small one-time goodwill boost, which doesn't worth IMO. This mod goes deep into diplomatic marriage alone by giving it a real CK-like purpose.


[b]- If I use MFI at the same time, will two similar diplomatic marriage events conflict? [/b]

No, I'm just inspired by MFI, but this mod is 100% standalone. If you have MFI, both diplomatic marriage events may trigger independently.

[b]- Under what circumstances will a PA expire?[/b]

1. Death of your child or child-in-law.
2. The allied faction is destroyed (Impossible in vanilla but it may happen with Dynamic Diplomacy or Rim War)
3. Changing ideology leader. Your ideology leader must have parenthood relation with the married pawn at any time. But passing leadership from father to mother or vice versa is OK.
4. The goodwill is too low. 

[b]- What happens after the PA expires? [/b]

Depending on the reason, the child of your leader will return alone, die, or stay in the ex permanent ally forever. In addition, if the goodwill is high enough when the PA expires, they will still stay as your vanilla ally.

[b]- After the PA expires, can I form a new one? [/b]

Yes, there is no limit of the total number of PA you can have per game, either with the same faction or a different one. But only one is allowed at a time.

[b]- Why is my goodwill with the PA faction still declining? [/b]

The PA will not eliminate the natural goodwill decay, nor the goodwill cost for calling reinforcements or caravans etc.. It only increases the goodwill each day to negate them.
