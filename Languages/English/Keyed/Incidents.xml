    <DMP_DiplomaticMarriagePlusProposal>
		Our ally, {0} has proposed a diplomatic marriage between the child of our colony leader, {1} and one of their important member {2}. 
		\nEffects if we accept:
		\n\n1. {1} will leave our colony and join {0}. 
		\n2. {2} will accept our ideology, and will randomly spread it in {0}. 
		\n3. The goodwill of {0} will be instantly maxed to 100, and will increase {3} every day if below 100. The increasing speed is determined by the social skill of {1}. 
		\n4. Natural goodwill decay and goodwill cost for reinforcement and caravan still apply, but will be quickly negated while permanent alliance is active. 
		\n5. If anyone of the couple dies, the permanent alliance will end. But {0} may stay as a regular ally if goodwill is high enough. 
		\n6. {0} will tolerate some degree of our negative actions. But if we go too far (goodwill drops below 0) the permanent alliance will be immediately broken and {1} will be in trouble! 
		\n7. {1} will still randomly visit our colony with {2}. But we need to protecting them at all cost to ensure our permanent alliance.
